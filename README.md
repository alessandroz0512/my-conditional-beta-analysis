# my-conditional-beta-analysis
This project investigates the asymmetric behavior of asset betas under different market conditions. Instead of assuming a constant beta as in the standard CAPM, the analysis estimates β⁺ (up-market beta) and β⁻ (down-market beta) to capture how sensitivity to the S&amp;P 500 varies depending on whether the market is rising or falling.
